# Qr-Code-scanner
The QR Code Scanner project is a Python application designed to efficiently decode QR codes using the OpenCV and pyzbar libraries. QR (Quick Response) codes are two-dimensional barcodes that encode various types of data, such as URLs, text, or contact information. This project provides a user-friendly interface where users can either scan QR codes through their webcam or upload an image containing a QR code for decoding. The application utilizes computer vision techniques provided by OpenCV to capture and process frames from the webcam in real-time. Once a QR code is detected within the frame, pyzbar library is employed to decode the QR code and extract the embedded information. The decoded data is then displayed to the user, offering a seamless experience for retrieving information encoded in QR codes. This project is ideal for developers looking to integrate QR code scanning capabilities into their applications or for individuals needing a reliable tool for decoding QR codes swiftly and accurately.
